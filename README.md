# math-equation
Solve math equation in string form.

The objective of this project is to create a simple code where a equation is written as a string variable, and the output is also a string.

As the project evolves, more functionalities should be added, such as resolving for "x" and so on. For now the project only resolves simple math equations with no variables, only numbers.

function.py has all logistic algorithms to make solving an equation possible.
  a more detailed explanation can be found inside it's own file.

main.py deals with some logistic problems, but mostly deals with getting the user's input and returning the correct output.
