# math-equation
Solve math equation in string form.


The objective of this project is to create a simple code where a equation is written as a string variable, and the output is the given equation solved also in string form.

As the project evolves, more functionalities should be added, such as resolving for "x" and so on. For now the project only resolves simple math equations with no variables, only numbers.

* main.py deals with some logistic problems, but mostly deals with getting the user's input and showing the correct output.

* function.py has all logistic algorithms to make solving an equation possible.
  a more detailed explanation can be found inside it's own file.
 
* test_function.py has all automated tests for the function.py file.
